/**
 * Talise Rewards — redemption catalogue (Phase 4).
 *
 * Pure constants. No DB, no fetch, no `server-only` pragma — safe to
 * import from anywhere on the server (the iOS app reads the filtered
 * catalogue via `/api/rewards/catalogue`, so client code never imports
 * this file directly, but keeping it pure means future-flagging this
 * for a web view is a copy-paste away).
 *
 * v1 inventory is hardcoded. There's no admin UI yet — when the user
 * wants to tune cost / description / availability they edit this file.
 *
 * Fulfillment kinds:
 *   `instant`  — auto-fulfilled at redeem time (no manual work)
 *   `flagged`  — stored as metadata on the redemption row; a future
 *                policy check reads it (e.g. fx_boost_until_ms). The
 *                redemption row's `status` flips to `fulfilled` at
 *                redeem time but the *effect* is deferred to other
 *                code paths that honor the metadata.
 *   `pending`  — requires manual outbound action (e.g. payout). The
 *                redemption row sits at `pending` until an operator
 *                flips it.

 * Yellow Card / Reloadly / Africa's Talking for real-time top-ups.
